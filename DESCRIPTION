Description: 'TroublemakeR' is an R package designed to generate .dat files for the 'AMPL'
             software using spatial data, particularly rasters. With this package, users can 
             easily create datasets for use with 'AMPL', a widely-used optimization modeling
             language. 'TroublemakeR' provides a range of methods for generating these datasets, 
             including support for various spatial data formats and different problem types. 
             By automating the process of generating 'AMPL' datasets, this package can help 
             streamline optimization workflows and make it easier to solve complex optimization 
             problems. The methods implemented in this package are described in detail in Fourer 
             et al. (2002) doi:10.1287/mnsc.36.5.519.
